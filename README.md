This is a RESTful web services API called MoviesAPI written using c# and ASP.NET framework.

It is an API I have written and communicates with local SQL server to both get data from the server and update new data,
as such the data is only mock data.

Using this API the user is able to view and update diffrent data regarding each entity, for example: view diffrent actors,their age,their movies and etc.

the API demonstrates diffrent knwoledge and uses of RESTful web services methodologies and proper code architecture.

The API is clearly divided into diffrent controllers and services for each entity, and in addition the repository pattern is demonstrated.

There are examples for diffrent entity relationships between the entities such as one to many and many to many.
